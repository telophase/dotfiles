# krita
On Linux, add each folder to your Krita resource folder at `~/.local/share/krita`. You can find your resource folder by runnign Krita and navigating to Settings > Configure Krita > General > Resources.

More of my Krita resources that I cannot include in this repository can be found listed [here on my website](https://gimon.zone/art/krita)
